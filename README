Appointment maker app for the Greek Embassy in London

NOTE: Please keep in mind that the source is very much work in progress

The app is in working order written in Java and uses MongoDb as its data store.
In order to run it you need a mongo instance running and set environmental variable MONGOLAB_URI, e.g. mongodb://heroku_app1234:random_password@ds029017.mongolab.com:29017/heroku_app1234

This app can be run on heroku. In order to make appointments, pending requests need to be found in mongodb of the form:

{ "_class" : "com.gdiama.domain.AppointmentRequest", "_id" : ObjectId("514f08de03645d3870c3beee"), "category" : "PASSPORT",
"contact" : { "email" : "email@email.com", "firstName" : "fname", "lastName" : "lname", "telephone" : "0770770000" },
"created_date" : ISODate("2013-01-24T14:08:30.951Z"), "status" : "PENDING" }

Supported categories are: PASSPORT, CERTIFICATES, MILITARY, PERMANENT_RESIDENCE
Successful requests that result into a booking will change the request status to 'BOOKED'

Example of an appointment:
 "_id" : ObjectId("514f3bed0364b068b55f1e01"), "_class" : "com.gdiama.domain.Appointment",
 "contact" : { "firstName" : "fname", "lastName" : "lname", "email" : "email@email.com", "telephone" : "0770770000" },
 "appointmentCategory" : "PASSPORT", "appointmentSlot" : ISODate("2013-04-22T08:30:00Z"), "bookedOn" : ISODate("2013-03-24T17:46:11.516Z") }

Scheduling is done via heroku's cron trigger addon that schedules a worker to run.

Future:
- Clean up code
- Provide a web interface to store requests
- Once satisfactory tested it will be made available to the public interested to make appointments via this service for free
